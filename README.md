# xyCMD
A Python "recreation" of the Command Prompt.

# Why?
I don't really know, I just wanted to mess with Python and something cool.
I also wanted to test the OS module and thought this was the best thing I could do.

# How?
As stated before, this uses the OS module for most actions (as well as subprocess for opening .EXEs)

# Features!
xyCMD provides simple commands like change (for changing directories), open (for opening applications) and read (for reading text files)
You can use the "help" command to look up the commands available.

# Not enough commands?
No problem! You can activate PowerUser Mode by typing the secret command in the command bar.
(Or you can just look in the code I guess)
